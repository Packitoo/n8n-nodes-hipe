4. Configure authentication (see below).

## Authentication

To use this node, you need an API token from HIPE.

- Enter your token in the HIPE credentials section when configuring the node in n8n.

> **Tip:** Hover over each parameter in the node UI for helpful descriptions.

### Pagination & Sorting

Companies and Projects List actions use flat pagination and sorting:

- Query params: `page`, `limit`, flat filters (e.g. `status`, `search`)
- Sorting: single `sort` parameter as "field,ASC|DESC"

See the full guide: [docs/pagination.md](./docs/pagination.md)
